# PINN_finite_plas

This is the code for PINN (physics informed neural network) for finte-strain plasticity with isotropic hardening. For more information, please refer to this journal article "Modeling finite-strain plasticity using physics-informed neural network and assessment of the network performance". https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622003532

**fefp_hole_new.py** contains main PINN formulation and forward training of the model.

**fefp_hole_new_post.py** is for post processing, including plot, error calculation and validation from Abaqus data.
